# RCOM - Computer Networks - FEUP
Course from the 2nd Semester of the 3rd year of Bachelor's Degree in Eletrical and Computers Engineering 

lab1 - Transferring files through a serial port: February 2022 - April 2022
Implementation of a protocol of TCP data transmission between two different computers through a serial port. Code written in C, structured in a way to optimize both the functions and the common variables shared between each process. In order to study the developed application, the sending of different sizes files, the presence of noise in the communication, the interruption of the connection for a few seconds and the change of bandwidth were tested.

lab2 - Configuration of a network and development of a download application: May 2022 - June 2022
In the course of several sessions in a laboratory with a setup of several computers connected through switches, and its own private LANs, we studied and made the computers network and its configuration. The development of a server-client application written in C, in which we used socket programming and TCP/IP connections to create an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) was also part of the project.
